  name: Outside Light Presence Evening v1.0
  description: >
    Automatically adjusts your light based on the sun's position and time of day.
    When it's dark after midday until your chosen end time, the light dims to a low level.
    If it's dark outside that window, motion or a door opening will turn the light on bright for a short time.
    A button lets you manually override: toggle boost in the evening, toggle the light on/off when it's dark, or turn it off during the day.

    motion_entity:
      name: Motion Sensor
      description: >
        A motion sensor that triggers the light to turn on at full brightness when motion is detected.
        This happens whenever it's dark, regardless of the time of day.

    door_entity:
      name: Door Sensor
      description: >
        A door sensor that triggers the light to turn on at full brightness when the door opens.
        Like the motion sensor, this  happens when it's dark.

    button_device:
      name: Button Device
      description: >
        A Zigbee-based wall button or remote (ZHA) used to manually control the light.
        Depending on the time of day, pressing the button will:
        - In the evening: toggle the boost on/off
        - When it's dark (outside the evening window): turn the light on or off
        - During the day: only turn the light off

    timer_entity:
      name: Timer Entity
      description: >
        A dedicated timer helper (create one in Settings → Automations & Scenes → Helpers).
        The automation will control the duration — you don't need to set the timer duration in the helper itself.
